            <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
            <p>This page doubles as a portfolio as well as a personal
                <br>blogpost where I'll document progress as I learn stuff
                <br>like new programming languages or random life skills.
                <br>I don't have too much planned at the moment but we'll
                <br>where this goes.</p>

                <p style="color: gold; font-size: large; font-style: italic;">
                    As of 4.7.24, I learned how to use the style attribute, so <br>
                    now I can make my web page look prettier. Or make it look like <br>
                    like someone threw up skittles. And some other stuff.<br></p>
                    <p>
                        I also learned how to use the span element, check this out:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is the color <span style="color: red;">red</span>.</li>
                        <li>This is the color <span style="color: blue">blue</span>.</li>
                        <li>This is the color <span style="color: green;">green</span>.</li>
                        <li>These words have a <span style="font-size: large;">large font size</span>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <b style="font-size: smaller">
                        These styles were implemented internally. I'm aware it's better to<br>
                        implement them using an external CSS file, but I haven't gotten to <br>
                        that point yet. Once I have a planned structure for what I want this<br>
                        website to be, I'll most likely just reformat everything. Or maybe<br>
                        write an entirely new index file. We'll see how I'm feeling.</b>
